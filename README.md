# SGIA (Sensirion Gas Index Algorithm)
ESP-IDF component for Sensision Gas Index Algorithm based on [Sensirion Gas Index Algorithm](https://github.com/Sensirion/gas-index-algorithm)

# Dependencies
This component only works with [ESP-IDF v5.2](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/release/v5.2) or higher.

The gas index algorithm depends on the values of the SGP41 and SHT4x sensors. The ESP-IDF components of these sensors are available at the following links:

- [SGP41 ESP-IDF component](https://github.com/mauriciobarroso/sgp41)
- [SGP41 ESP-IDF component](https://github.com/mauriciobarroso/sht4x)

# How to use
